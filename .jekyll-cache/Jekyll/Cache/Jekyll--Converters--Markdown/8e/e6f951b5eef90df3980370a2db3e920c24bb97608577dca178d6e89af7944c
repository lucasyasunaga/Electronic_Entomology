<p>This post is a documentation of a brief experiment on a bug with a new energy harvesting organ - radio antenna. This experiment is based on “FM snake” device developped by <a href="http://www.ericbrasseur.org/electrosmog_snake.html">Eric Brasseur</a> and adapted to be integrated to a bug.</p>

<h2 id="antenna">Antenna</h2>

<p>In the article Eric demonstrats harvesting energy from FM radiotower ranging from 88 ~ 100 MHz located 1 kilometer away. It is surprising how strong the signal is. It does make sence considering how far it is trying to transmit but it is something I totaly forget when I am close to the towers. I kind of get the frear of radio waves and aluminum and magnetic shealding for your home. Not that I feel the need to do these things but remembering how strong these electrical magnetic pulses that radiates for miles penetrating through objects, I can empathise with that fear.</p>

<p>It is such an available forces that is present all the time. It is interesting this technique is not populerised as much as I thought. I presume it does not produce anywhere enough current and voltage for any common electroic devices we use today. Though it did produce enough for lighting an LED light - at least 1.2V ish and only need few micro-amp.</p>

<h2 id="energy-harvesting-organ">Energy Harvesting Organ</h2>

<p>Here is the schematic of this organ below. Adaptation of Dipole antenna design form Eric’s website. There are pair of shotkey diodes and insulated wire. I have replaced LED (load) to positive and negative for my bug.</p>

<p>Dipole anntenna length can be calculated with formula provided by this article <a href="https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/antennas-propagation/dipole-antenna/length-calculations-equation-formula.php">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>length (m) = 150 * A / f</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A = variable from the guage of wire tipically 0.98 <br />
f = frequency</p>

<p>Acording to the article detection diodes should be located at the 1/4 length of the entire length. The total length is adjusted to the frequency of the radio tower near by.</p>

<h2 id="hunt-for-the-tower">Hunt for the tower</h2>

<p>Trough the website <a href="https://fmscan.org/">fmscan.org</a> I found the radio tower located near New Haven CT in Westrock. I have seen this tower when I hiked around that area before.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/post/tower2.jpg" alt="img for " width="600" style="vertical-align:middle" /> 
<img src="/assets/img/post/tower3.jpg" alt="img for " width="600" style="vertical-align:middle" /> 
<img src="/assets/img/post/tower4.jpg" alt="img for " width="600" style="vertical-align:middle" /></p>

<p>The tower is transmitting 94.3 mhz so</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>150 * 0.98 / 94.3 = 1.55m</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did make the antenna to be extra 10 cm long to start with just incase and I can cut to adjust to the needs. When I arrived to the location, length I brought was not producing any sounds so I trimmed a few round and at 158cm, it started to make sounds! It seems like some times it made more sounds in a different location of the parkinlot that I was situated 1/4 miles away form the tower. Close to a building seem to deflect the waves and wind sometime is affecting as well. In this setup, frequency of the oscilator in the bug is corlating to the voltage it’s getitng form the antenna.</p>

<p>I have relacated to another location that was about 1/2 mile away from the tower and the bug still made some sound in some position and location. It was more faint sounds but it is amazing how far this device can harvest energy from the tower. 
For this experiment, the circuit of the bug was extremly simple. Single oscilator that was set to be high frequency since I was expecting low voltage and current from the harvesting organ.</p>

<p>I am not ocated in Philladelphia so I will make another harvesting organ for new bugs that is native to Philly radio towers. Many experriments to come.</p>
