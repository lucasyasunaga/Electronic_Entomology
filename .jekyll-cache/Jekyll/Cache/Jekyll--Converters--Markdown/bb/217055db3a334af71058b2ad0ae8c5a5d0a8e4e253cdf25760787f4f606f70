<p>This post is a documentation of a brief experiment on a bug with a new energy harvesting organ - radio antenna. This experiment is based on “FM snake” device developped by <a href="http://www.ericbrasseur.org/electrosmog_snake.html">Eric Brasseur</a> and adapted to be integrated to a bug.</p>

<h2 id="antenna">Antenna</h2>

<p>In the article Eric demonstrats harvesting energy from FM radiotower ranging from 88 ~ 100 MHz located 1 kilometer away. It is surprising how strong the signal is. It does make sence considering how far it is trying to transmit but it is something I totaly forget when I am close to the towers. I kind of get the frear of radio waves and aluminum and magnetic shealding for your home. Not that I feel the need to do these things but remembering how strong these electrical magnetic pulses that radiates for miles penetrating through objects, I can empathise with that fear.</p>

<p>It is such an available forces that is present all the time. It is interesting this technique is not populerised as much as I thought. I presume it does not produce anywhere enough current and voltage for any common electroic devices we use today. Though it did produce enough for lighting an LED light - at least 1.2V ish and only need few micro-amp.</p>

<p>Here is the schematic of this organ below. Adaptation of Dipole antenna design form Eric’s website. There are pair of shotkey diodes and insulated wire. I have replaced LED (load) to positive and negative for my bug.</p>

<p>Dipole anntenna length can be calculated with formula provided by this article <a href="https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/antennas-propagation/dipole-antenna/length-calculations-equation-formula.php">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>length (m) = 150 * A / f</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A = variable from the guage of wire tipically 0.96 <br />
f = frequency</p>

<p>Acording to the article detection diodes should be located at the 1/4 length of the entire length. The total length is adjusted to the frequency of the radio tower near by.</p>

<h2 id="hunt-for-the-tower">Hunt for the tower</h2>

<p>Trough the website <a href="https://fmscan.org/">fmscan.org</a> I found the radio tower located near New Haven CT in Westrock. I have seen this tower when I hiked around that area before.</p>

<p>I have implemented these handmade resistors to number of bugs, and grouped under the name <a href="http://electronicentomology.com/catalogue/categoryPage/clay/">“clay”</a>.</p>

<p>Bugs that has this resistors that are logged are so far, <a href="http://electronicentomology.com/catalogue/piezo/bon/">Bon</a>, <a href="http://electronicentomology.com/catalogue/piezo/chirpy/">chirpy</a>, <a href="http://electronicentomology.com/catalogue/piezo/nanashi_sateraito/">nanashi_sateraito</a>, and <a href="http://electronicentomology.com/catalogue/piezo/lucasito/">lucasisto</a>.</p>

<p>Something I have noticed. The resistance of these resistors has been changing over time, it seems depends on the humidity? Exposed clay may be sensitive to the moisture and temperature of the air. This is just a hunch but might be worth experimenting more.</p>
