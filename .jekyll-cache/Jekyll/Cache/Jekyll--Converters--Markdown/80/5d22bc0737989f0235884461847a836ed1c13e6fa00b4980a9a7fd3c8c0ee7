<p>I am working on a bug for my baby to come. I was thinking of how baby can interact with bugs. In the pile of things my friend gave us for the baby there was a stuffed animal with rattley things inside them. It makes a nice sound. This game me an idea of rattle to become a new organ for the bugs.</p>

<h3 id="odradek---crumbs">Odradek - crumbs</h3>

<p>There are always a pile of componetns and cut off wires and broken bits that accumilate on the conor of my work desk. Wheather they are the left over from the breadboard prototypes or replaced and discarded from a working project, they are crumbs - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cares_of_a_Family_Man">Odradek</a>  - useless broken off bits and pieces. Rattle element integrates the odradek back into the system, not as a working components but as odradek - pile of crumbs to be a part of system.</p>

<p>I really love this plastic capsuls. I always kept my treasures in them. This capsul is the body of the rattle element. Two exposed wires inside are bent and layed on the bottom of the capsul with some space apart. Loose capacitors, resistors, diodes and other bits can trouch each of the components when we shake the capsul. Below video is measuring the resistance of the two pole. Depending on the chance of what is touching inside and how they are touching eachothers, the resistance is continuously changing.</p>

<h2 id="antenna">Antenna</h2>

<p>In the article Eric demonstrates harvesting energy from FM radio tower ranging from 88 ~ 100 MHz located 1 kilometer away. It is surprising how strong the signal is. It does make sense considering how far it is trying to transmit but it is something I totally forget when I am close to the towers. I kind of get the fear of radio waves and aluminum and magnetic shedding for your home. Not that I feel the need to do these things but remembering how strong these electrical magnetic pulses that radiates for miles penetrating through objects, I can empathies with that fear.</p>

<p>It is such an available forces that is present all the time. It is interesting this technique is not popularized as much as I thought. I presume it does not produce anywhere enough current and voltage for any common electronic devices we use today. Though it did produce enough for lighting an LED light - at least 1.2V ish and only need few micro-amp.</p>

<h2 id="energy-harvesting-organ">Energy Harvesting Organ</h2>

<p>Here is the schematic of this organ below. Adaptation of Dipole antenna design form Eric’s website. There are pair of shotkey diodes and insulated wire. I have replaced LED (load) to positive and negative for my bug.</p>

<p>Referenced from <a href="http://www.ericbrasseur.org/electrosmog_snake.html">http://www.ericbrasseur.org/electrosmog_snake.html</a></p>

<p>Dipole antenna length can be calculated with formula provided by this article <a href="https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/antennas-propagation/dipole-antenna/length-calculations-equation-formula.php">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>length (m) = 150 * A / f</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A = variable from the gage of wire typically 0.98 <br />
f = frequency</p>

<p>According to the article detection diodes should be located at the 1/4 length of the entire length. The total length is adjusted to the frequency of the radio tower near by.</p>

<h2 id="hunt-for-the-tower">Hunt for the tower</h2>

<p>Trough the website <a href="https://fmscan.org/">fmscan.org</a> I found the radio tower located near New Haven CT in WestRock. I have seen this tower when I hiked around that area before.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/post/tower2.jpg" alt="img for " width="600" style="vertical-align:middle" />

<img src="/assets/img/post/tower4.jpg" alt="img for " width="600" style="vertical-align:middle" /></p>

<p>The tower is transmitting 94.3 mhz so</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>150 * 0.98 / 94.3 = 1.55m</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did make the antenna to be extra 10 cm long to start with just in case and I can cut to adjust to the needs. When I arrived to the location, length I brought was not producing any sounds so I trimmed a few round and at 158cm, it started to make sounds! It seems like some times it made more sounds in a different location of the parking lot that I was situated 1/4 miles away form the tower. Close to a building seem to deflect the waves and wind sometime is affecting as well. In this setup, frequency of the oscillator in the bug is correlating to the voltage it’s getting form the antenna.</p>

<p>I have relocated to another location that was about 1/2 mile away from the tower and the bug still made some sound in some position and location. It was more faint sounds but it is amazing how far this device can harvest energy from the tower. 
For this experiment, the circuit of the bug was extremely simple. Single oscillator that was set to be high frequency since I was expecting low voltage and current from the harvesting organ.</p>

<p>I am now located in Philadelphia so I will make another harvesting organ for new bugs that is native to Philly radio towers. Many experiments to come.</p>
