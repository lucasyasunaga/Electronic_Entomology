<p>After two years, I am finally updating some studies I have done.</p>

<h3 id="thing-that-resists">Thing that resists</h3>

<p>Here I will post on my exploration of hand made component - resistor. Starting from the question “could I use anything if the material resist?” Resistor provides precise amount of resistance to the circuit, controlling the flow. As the word “resistor” describe, things that resist.</p>

<h3 id="symbols-and-material">Symbols and Material</h3>

<p>As I am working with the design of circuits for each bugs, these elemental materials becomes symbols. Symbols that represent the material quality. This abstraction allow me to focus and conceptualize the relationships made in a particular scale. Material disappears and just shapes are left - to be able to see the entire forest.</p>

<p>But there is always a gap between symbols and materials. Idea and actuality. Recipes and cooked meal. Words and feelings. There is a song by a band called くるり quruli that is “言葉はさんかく　こころは四角” which translates to “words are triangle, feelings are square” there will always be a gap. There is something about working with circuits, (maybe partly because my lack in depth in technical knowledge) it is a process of seeing this difference between preceved idea and materiality. It reminds me that there is always unknown left lerking. Infinite grainy variables that can’t be captured. Platonic ιδέα、idea can not exist. We are just left with the noise. The gap.</p>

<h2 id="materials">Materials</h2>

<p>Many resistors uses carbon as a main material to provide indicated value of resistance. Carbon is a semiconductive material that conductivity can be controlled with mixture with other materials. In early 20th centry resistor was made with carbon and ceramic and resin (maybe still the case too?). I had a wood charcoal from a firepit that I crushed up mixed with acuired powered charcoal for carbon, and clay harvested from Eastern Shore Maryland. I needed them like a bread. I have put the mixture on to two copper wires that are couple millimeter apart. After it was dry, I have checked the resistance. Number of them ranged from 80K ohm to 600K ohm. Some iteration with too little carbon did not conduct at all.</p>

<p>I have implemented this handmade resistors to number of bugs, and grouped under the name <a href="http://electronicentomology.com/catalogue/categoryPage/clay/">“clay”</a>.</p>

<p>Bugs that has this resistors that are logged are so far, <a href="http://electronicentomology.com/catalogue/piezo/bon/">Bon</a>, <a href="http://electronicentomology.com/catalogue/piezo/chirpy/">chirpy</a>, <a href="http://electronicentomology.com/catalogue/piezo/nanashi_sateraito/">nanashi_sateraito</a>, and <a href="http://electronicentomology.com/catalogue/piezo/lucasito/">lucasisto</a>.</p>
