<h2> 74HC14 Schmitt Trigger Inverter --- <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hc14.pdf"> data sheet</a></h2>

<p> Many of bugs from this species uses common CMOS(Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) chip called Schmitt Trigger Inverter. CMOS chips are logic IC(integrated circuit) chip family that has premade miniture circuit in them. Schmitt Trigger is often used to convert complex analog signals to digital loogic. Basically it can look at imput voltage and when the imput is higher than the threshold, it can say the logic is HIGH. It can also say logic is LOW when the imput voltage is below the threshold. So it can recognize the change of voltage in binary fashon. Finally, it is also an inverter circuit which means that if the imput voltage goes above the threshold it registers logic as LOW instead of HIGH.

There are 6 independent schmitt trigger inverter circuits in 74HC14 chip. By bridging input and output of the inverter
