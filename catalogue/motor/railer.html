This parasitic bugs collaborate with architecture and gives a material voice to them.<br><br>
railer has a spring loaded mechanical organ that creates snap action once in a several minutes. This organ is based off of music box geared motor. Very slow rotation of motor turns the cam slowly. The cam presses the rocker arm that is spring loaded slowly increasing in distance that it presses the rocker down. When the cam gets to the edge of the curve and resets, rocker arm snapped back and hits the railing.
