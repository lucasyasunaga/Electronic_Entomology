<p>
Budgie as known as Budgerigar has some bird seeds on it's body.
One of leg have come off once and have went through a minor repair. <br><br>

Usually pretty quiet as it gently clicks for a while then it let itself known with bubly giggles. 

One of 26 bugs that participated in the installation <a href="http://yasunaga.work/receptacle.html">"gathering"</a> as well as one of the main participant of the <a href="http://yasunaga.work/vessel_for_10_suns.html">"vessel for 10 suns "</a></p>
