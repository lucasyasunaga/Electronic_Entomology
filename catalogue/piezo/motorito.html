<p>Motorito (little engine) was left in Taos, New Mexico. Motorito sits on the shelf next to the window facing the mountains. It starts the day with slow growl, gradually the tone rises and rhythm gets faster as the sun rises.

Slowly adds chirps to the mix and ticks once the edge of the sunlight creeps up to motorito. Someday motorito will just growl the whole day.

    Motorito is an adaptation of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/catalogue/piezo/gentle_engine/">gentle_engine</a> circuit. After gentle_engine was sent off to Argentina, out of little bit of loneness, I made another one that resembled the gentle_engine.

	”可愛い子には旅をさせよ” There is an expression in Japanese that translate to something like, "let your beloved child travel away" It means that if you love your child, make them travel on their own and let themselves be strong and don't spoil too much keeping them around you. I don't have a human child just yet but maybe I sort of sympathies the dilemma of wanting to keep them around and also want them to be in the world.
