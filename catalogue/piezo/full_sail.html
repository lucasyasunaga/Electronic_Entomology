Full sail makes a sound of crashing wave. Flexible solar cell resembles the sail of the sailboat. It cries with shaggy textrual expanding sound that resembles chaotic but yet consistant sound of a wave in the ocean. </p>

There are three oscilators feeing into eachother and connected in a circle. Forth oscilator is a voice that gets affected by those mixes. One of the connections betwen the oscitator is connected with bluewhale mixing, which is a mixing technique from <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/catalogue/piezo/bluewhale/"> bluewhale</a> that seems to produce granular texture.
